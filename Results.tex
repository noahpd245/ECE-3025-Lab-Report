\section{RESULTS}

\subsection{Normalized Voltages}
A table containing Normalized Voltages can be found in \autoref{app:norm data}. To normalize our data, we subtracted the ambient voltage (\SI{5.1}{\milli\volt}) from all of our measured values and then divided by the maximum voltage observed (\SI{517.6}{\milli\volt} at $\theta = -14\degree$).
    %a) A table of normalized voltages, derived from the data table in the second section

\subsection{Raised Cosine Parameter}
The value of the Raised Cosine Parameter $n$ was found using the MATLAB Code in \autoref{app:matlab code}. We read in our data, and normalized it, and found the best least squares fit for our data using the equation:
\[\text{error} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}[V_{norm}(\theta_{si}) - \cos^{n}(\theta_{si})]^{2}\]
We used a range of exponents ranging from 0 to 100 with a 0.1 step size and found the best fit exponent to be 33.1 with a normalized error of 0.0077.

    %b) The value of the raised cosine parameter, n, determined by the curve-fitting procedure. Details on the curve fit process should be provided as necessary.

\subsection{Peak Radiation Intensity}
To find the approximate peak radiation intensity, we used the equation:
\[K_{0}\approx \frac{P_{0}}{A_{r}}R^{2}\: \: [W/sr]\]
which uses the maximum power $P_0$, determined from our measurements to be \SI{1.0352}{\micro\watt}, the aperture area measured as \SI{0.374}{mm^2}, and the distance R from the LED to the aperture of \SI{153.63}{mm}. 
    %c) The value of the peak radiation intensity, K0 in the proper units

\[P = \frac{2 \pi K_{0}}{n+1}\: \: [W]\]
