\section{DATA}
\subsection{Collection Methodology}
The following precautions were taken to minimize any error introduced in collecting data.

\begin{itemize}
    \item We set the aperture radius precisely by closing it flush around a nominally .7mm stick of lead.
    \item We re-purposed multimeter boxes - which we used as four black walls surrounding our apparatus, minimizing variations in light noise which we noticed could be attributed to movements of the observer. The resulting change in milliVolts detected after installation of the black walls was notable, having decreased by about 20mV. Inevitable background radiation was still present, but having audited previous measurements at certain angles at random, and finding no difference, we safely conclude the background radiation was effectively constant, which we account for in our subsequent computations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tabulated Results}
The raw collected data can be found in Appendix A
